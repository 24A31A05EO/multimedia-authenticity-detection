📌 Multimedia Authenticity Detection System

An AI-based system designed to detect fake and manipulated multimedia content, including Emails, URLs, Images, Audio, and Videos.
The project strengthens digital trust and online safety by identifying phishing attempts, AI-generated content, and deepfakes.

🎯 Project Objectives

Detect fake emails and phishing URLs

Identify AI-generated or manipulated images

Analyze synthetic audio

Detect deepfake videos

Provide a centralized dashboard with real-time statistics
